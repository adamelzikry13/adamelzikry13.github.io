            <p>If you work in finance, you've likely heard of the video urging viewers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw29h7LhEuE">buy $1 of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013</a>. A decade later, BTC crossed $100,000, symbolizing the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traditionally, countries hold assets like gold, foreign currencies (USD/EUR), and bonds in reserves to stabilize economies and prevent crises. The rise of decentralized digital currencies, however, raises a key question: should cryptocurrencies be included in national reserves?</p>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies offer high returns, diversification, and inflation protection but face challenges such as volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity risks. This project explores the feasibility and implications of adding cryptocurrencies to reserves, focusing on global competitiveness, risk management, and economic stability. It examines how cryptocurrencies could enhance financial diversity, act as an inflation hedge, and provide a competitive edge in a digitalized global economy while weighing risks like market volatility and the absence of regulatory frameworks.</p>
            <p>By analyzing financial data, and economic trends from countries experimenting with digital assets, this study aims to offer policymakers actionable insights. Ultimately, it seeks to determine whether cryptocurrencies can strengthen financial resilience or if their volatility makes them unsuitable for inclusion in national reserves.</p>

            <h1>Analytical Challenges</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">During my research, I encountered several challenges with data access and visualization. Many charts had to be scrapped due to paywalled or gated data, and attempts at web scraping often resulted in 403 Forbidden errors. This was a problem for me since initially, most of the data that I would be using was obtained through scraping. To resolve this, Finn suggested using headers or Selenium, which enabled me to scrape data like <a href="https://bitbo.io/volatility/"> BTC volatility</a>.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">I initially planned to use APIs for crypto prices, volumes, and market caps but found that free APIs, such as CoinMarketCap, lacked historical data unless upgraded to a paid plan. Instead, I relied on CSV files from sources like Investing.com to fill this gap.
                I also faced an issue with the volatility rates. The data was either unavailable in the needed format or not downloadable. To address this, I used NumPy to calculate average yearly volatility from collected data, enabling the creation of a risk-return chart.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">Lastly, I faced issues embedding Python-generated interactive charts into HTML. Despite trying PyScript, it didn't solve the problem. I switched to using VegaLite charts, which allowed me to display my data effectively. These workarounds ensured I could analyze and present insights successfully, despite initial setbacks.</p> 
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" class="section conclusion" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1500">Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) once dismissed as fads by major banks and investment companies, are now seen as a legitimate investment even having Spot ETFs. The data above show increasing crypto adoption from 2019 till 2024. This trend indicates cryptocurrencies are becoming more mainstream. The data also reveals crypto's volatility compared to traditional assets such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). They offer high returns but at the cost of high volatility. Which is the total opposite of traditional assets like gold and fiat currencies since they have proved themselves as traditional currencies thus no price speculation would occur. Bitcoin's high growth potential is paired with its risks. Whereas gold and bonds offer stability and low to moderate returns. Countries looking to adopt BTC should combine these assets to achieve growth and reduce their risk.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">Bitcoin's liquidity surpasses traditional assets like gold and silver which is caused by numerous external factors such as halving cycles or a bull run. This high liquidity ensures governments are able to sell off their BTC without having an impact on the market. If we take a look at smaller economies such as El Salvador for example, where BTC is considered as legal tender, They leveraged BTC for diversification and its potential growth. However developed economies like the US and China hold it strategically. Therefore, we can conclude that high inflation nations use Bitcoin as a hedge due to its decentralization and fixed supply while larger economies see it as a complementary asset.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">Thus, should countries include crypto in their reserves? Yes, selectively. Crypto can diversify, quickly grow and modernize reserves, but its volatility requires pairing with traditional assets to ensure balance. As the saying goes, Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket</p>
